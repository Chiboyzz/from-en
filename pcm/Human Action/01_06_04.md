### Case Probability

Case probability means: We know, wit regard to de particular event, some of de factors wey determine im outcome; but oda determining factors about dey wey we know nothing.

Case probability get nothing in common wit class probability but de incompleteness of our knowledge. For every oda regard de two dey entirely different.

Dere be, of course, plenty instances for wey men try to forecast particular future event on de basis of dia knowledge about de behavior of de class. Doctor fit determine de chances for de full recovery of o, patient if e know say 70 per cent wey dey afflicted wit de same disease recova. If im expresses im judgment correctly, im no go say more dan dat de probability of recovery is ::0.7::, dat is, say out of ten patients not more dan three on de average die. All such predictions about external events, i.e., events for de field of de natural sciences, are of dis character. Dem be in fact no fit forecasts about de issue of de case in question, but statements about de frequency of de various possible outcomes. Dem based either on statistical information or simply on de rough estimate of de frequency derived from nonstatistical experience.

So far as dis types of probable statements dey concerned, we no dey faced wit case probability. In fact we no know anything about de case in question except say e dey instance of a class de behavior of which we know or we think say we know.

A surgeon tells one patient wey considers submitting imself to an operation wey thirty out of every hundred undergoing dis kind operation die. If de patient asks wheda dis number of deaths dey already full, im done misunderstood de sense of de doctor's statement. E done fall prey to de error dem know as de "gambler's fallacy." Like de roulette player wey concludes from a run of ten red for succession say de probability of de next turn being black e dey greater dan e be before de run, e confuses case probability wit class probability.

All medical prognoses, wen dem based only on general physiological knowledge, deal wit class probability. Doctor wey hear say man wey him no know done seized by definite illness, on de basis of im general medical experience, say: Im chances for recovery dey 7 to 3. If de doctor imself treats de patient, e fit get different opinion. De patient na young, vigorous man; im dey good health before dem take am wit de illness. For dis kind case, de doctor fit think, de mortality figures dey lower; de chances for dis patient no dey 7:3, but 9:1. De logical approach remains de same, although e fit no based on a collection of statistical data, but simply on a more or less exact resume of de doctor's own experience wit previous cases. Waitin de doctor know dey always only de behavior of classes. For our instance de class na de class of young, vigorous men dem seized by de illness in question.

Case probability na particular feature of our dealing wit problems of human action. Here any reference to frequency dey inappropriate, as our statements dey always deal wit unique events wey as such--i.e., wit regard to de problem in questionâ€”no be members of any class. We fit form a class "American presidential elections." Dis class concept fit prove useful or even necessary for different kind of reasoning, as, for instance, for de treatment of de matter from de viewpoint of constitutional law. But if we dey deal wit de election of 1944--either, before de election, wit im future outcome or, after de election, wit analysis of de factors wey determined de outcome--we dey grappling wit individual, unique, and nonrepeatable case. De case dey characterized by im unique merits, na class by imself. All de marks wey make e dey permissible to subsume am under any class are irrelevant for de problem in question.

Two football teams, de Blues and de Yellows, go play tomorrow. For de past de Blues done always defeated de Yellows. Dis knowledge no be knowledge about de class of events. If we go consider am as such, we go get to conclude say de Blues dey always victorious and say de Yellows dey always dey defeated. We no go fit dey uncertain wit regard to de outcome of de game. We go know for certain say se Blues go win again. De mere fact say we consider our forecast about tomorrow's game as only probable shows say we no dey argue dis way.

On de oda hand, we believe say de fact say de Blues dey victorious for de past no immaterial wit regard to de outcome of tomorrow's game. We consider am as a favorable prognosis for de repeated success of de Blues. If we go argue correctly according to de reasoning appropriate to class probability, we no go attach any importance to dis fact. If we no go resist de erroneous conclusion of de "gambler's fallacy," we go, on de contrary, argue say tomorrow's game go result for de success of de Yellows.

If we risk some money on de chance of one team's victory, de lawyers go qualify our action as a bet. Dem go call am gambling if class probability dey involved.

Everything wey outside de field of class probability dey commonly implied for de term probability refers to de peculiar mode of reasoning involved for dealing wit historical uniqueness or individuality, de specific understanding of de historical sciences.

Understanding dey always based on incomplete knowledge. We fit believe say we know de motives of de acting men, de ends dem dey aim at, and de means dem plan to apply for de attainment of these ends. We get a definite opinion wit regard to de effects to be expected from de operation of these factors. But dis knowledge dey defective. We no fit exclude beforehand de possibility say we get erred for e appraisal of dia influence or dem failed to take into consideration some factors wey interference we no foresee am at all, or not in a correct way.

Gambling, engineering, and speculating dey three different modes of dealing wit de future.

De gambler know nothing about de event on which de outcome of im gambling depends. All wey im know na de frequency of a favorable outcome of a series of dis kind events, knowledge wey dey useless for im undertaking. He trusts to good luck, say na im only plan.

Life itself is exposed to many risks. At any moment it is endangered by disastrous accidents which cannot be controlled, or at least not sufficiently. Every man banks on good luck. He counts upon not being struck by lightning and not being bitten by a viper. There is an element of gambling in human life. Man can remove some of the chrematistic consequences of such disasters and accidents by taking out insurance policies. In doing so he banks upon the opposite chances. On the part of the insured the insurance is gambling. His premiums were spent in vain if the disaster does not occur.[^2] With regard to noncontrollable natural events man is always in the position of a gambler.

The engineer, on the other hand, knows everything that is needed for a technologically satisfactory solution of his problem, the construction of a machine. As far as some fringes of uncertainty are left in his power to control, he tries to eliminate them by taking safety margins. The engineer knows only soluble problems and problems which cannot be solved under the present state of knowledge. He may sometimes discover from adverse experience that his knowledge was less complete than he had assumed and that he failed to recognize the indeterminateness of some issues which he thought he was able to control. Then he will try to render his knowledge more complete. Of course he can never eliminate altogether the element of gambling present in human life. But it is his principle to operate only within an orbit of certainty. He aims at full control of the elements of his action.

It is customary nowadays to speak of "social engineering." Like planning, this term is a synonym for dictatorship and totalitarian tyranny. The idea is to treat human beings in the same way in which the engineer treats the stuff out of which he builds bridges, roads, and machines. The social engineer's will is to be substituted for the will of the various people he plans to use for the construction of his utopia. Mankind is to be divided into two classes: the almighty dictator, on the one hand, and the underlings who are to be reduced to the status of mere pawns in his plans and cogs in his machinery, on the other. If this were feasible, then of course the social engineer would not have to bother about understanding other people's actions. He would be free to deal with them as technology deals with lumber and iron.

In the real world acting man is faced with the fact that there are fellow men acting on their own behalf as he himself acts. The necessity to adjust his actions to other people's actions makes him a speculator for whom success and failure depend on his greater or lesser ability to understand the future. Every action is speculation. There is in the course of human events no stability and consequently no safety.

[^2]: In life insurance the insured's stake spent in vain consists only in the difference between the amount collected and the amount he could have accumulated by saving.

### De Alter Ego

If we dey prepared to take de term causality for e broadest sense, teleology fit be called one variety of causal inquiry. Final causes na first of all causes. De cause of one event dey seen as one action por quasi-action wey dey aim at some end.

Both primitive man and de infant, for one naïve anthropomorphic attitude, consider am quite plausible say every change and event na de outcome of de action of one being wey dey act in de same way as dem dey do themselves. Dem believe say animals, plants, mountains, rivers, and fountains, even stones and celestial bodies, na, like themselves, dey feel, dey will, and dey act as beings. Only for one later stage of cultural development nai man go renounce dis animistic ideas and substitute de mechanistic world view for dem. Mechanicalism prove to be so satisfactory one principle of conduct wey people finally believe am to dey capable to dey solve all de problems of thought and scientific research. Materialism and panphysicalism proclaim mechanicalism as de essence of all knowledge and de experimental and mathematical method of de natural sciences as de sole scientific mode to dey think.

All changes dey to be comprehended as motions subject to de laws of mechanics.

De champions of mechanicalism nor dey bother about de problems wey dem never solve of de logical and epistemological basis of de principles of causality and imperfect induction. For their eyes dis principles na sound because dem dey work. De fact say experiment for de laboratory bring about de result wey de theory predict and say machines for de factory run for one way wey de technology predict prove, dem say, de soundness of de method and findings of modern natural science. Granted say science nor fit give us truth—and who knows wetin de truth really means?—for any rate e dey certain say e work to dey lead us to success.

But e dey precisely when we accept dis pragmatic point of view say de emptiness of de panphysicalist dogma become manifest. Science, as e don point come out before, never succeed to dey solve de problem of de mind-body relations. De panphysicalists certainly nor go fit contend say de procedures dem recommend don ever work for de field of interhuman relations and of de social sciences. But e dey beyond doubt say de principle according to which one _Ego_ deals with every human being as if de other na one thinking and acting being like imself don evidence e usefulness both for mundane life and for scientific research. E nor go fit dey denied say e work.

E dey beyond doubt say  de practice to dey consider fellow men as beings who think and act like me, de Ego, do don turn out well; on de other hand, de prospects look hopeless to dey get one similar pragmatic verification for de postulate wey require dem to dey treated in de same manner as de object of de natural sciences. The epistemological problems wey de comprehension of other people behaviour raise dey no less intricate than those of causality and incomplete induction. e fit dey admitted say e dey impossible to provide conclusive evidence for de propositions say my logic na de logic of all other people and by all means  na absolutely de only logic and say de categories of all human actions na de categories of all other people action and by all means na absolutely de categories of all human action. Anyhow as  e be, de pragmatist must remember say dis propositions work both in practice and in science, and de positivist must not overlook de fact say to dey address e fellow men he presupposes –tacitly and implicitly—de intersubjective validity of logic and thereby de reality of de realm of de alter Ego’s thought and action, of e own eminent human character [^8]. 

Thinking and acting na de specific human features of man. Dem dey peculiar to all human beings. Dem na, beyond membership for de zoological species homo sapiens, de characteristic mark of man as man. Nor be de scope of praxeology to investigate de relation of thinking and acting. For praxeology, e dey enough to establish say na only one logic wey dey intelligible to de human mind, and dat na only one mode of action wey be human and comprehensible to de human mind. Whether dem dey or fit dey for somewhere other beings—superhuman or subhuman—who think and act for one different way, dey beyond de reach of de human mind. We must restrict our endeavors to de study of human action.

Dis human action wey dey inextricably linked with human thought dey conditioned by logical necessity. E dey impossible for de human mind to conceive logical relations at variance with de logical structure of our mind. E dey impossible for de human mind to conceive one mode of action wey de categories go different from de categories wey determine our own actions.

For man na only two principles dey available for one mental grasp of reality, namely, those of theological and causality. Wetin nor go fit come under either of dis categories dey absolutely hidden to de human mind. One event wey nor open to one interpretation by one of dis two principles for man dey  inconceivable and mysterious. Change go fit dey conceive as de outcome of either of de operation of mechanistic causality or of purposeful  behaviour; for de human mind, e nor get third way wey dey available[^9]. Na true, as already mentioned, say teleology go fit dey viewed as one variety of causality. But de establishment of dis fact nor dey annul de essential differences between de two categories.

De panmechanistic world view dey committed to one methodological monism; e acknowledge only mechanistic causality because e attribute to am alone any cognitive value or at least one higher cognitive value than teleology. Dis na one metaphysical superstition. Both principles of cognition—causality and teleology –na, owing to de limitations of human reason, dey imperfect and nor dey convey ultimate knowledge. Causality leads to one _regressus in infinitum_ wey reason nor go fit exhaust. Teleology dey found wanting as soon as de question dey raised of wetin move de prime mover. Either method stop for one ultimate wey dem give wey nor go fit dey analyzed and interpreted. Reasoning and scientific inquiry nor go ever fit bring full ease of mind, apodictic certainty, and perfect cognition of all things. He wey seek dis must apply to faith and try to quiet e conscience by to dey embrace one creed or one metaphysical doctrine. 

If we nor transcend de realm of reason and experience, we nor go fit help to dey acknowledge say our fellow men dey act. We nor dey free to disregard dis fact for de sake of one fashionable prepossession and one arbitrary opinion. Daily experience prove not only say de sole suitable method to dey study de conditions of our nonhuman environment dey provided by de category of causality; e prove no less to dey convince say our fellow men na acting beings as we ourselves be. For de comprehension of action one scheme of interpretation and analysis dey available, namely, same provided by de cognition and analysis of our own purposeful behaviour. 

De problem of de study and analysis of other people action dey in no way connected with de problem of de existence of one _soul_ or of one _immortal soul_. As far as de objection of empiricism, behaviorism, positivism dey directed against any variety of de soul-theory, dem be of no avail be our problem. De question we go deal with na whether e dey possible to grasp human action intellectually if one refuse to comprehend am as meaningful and purposeful behavior to dey aim for de attainment of definite ends.  Behaviorism and positivism wan apply de method of de empirical natural sciences to de reality of human action. Dem interpret am as one response to stimuli. But dis stimuli themselves nor dey open to description by de method of natural sciences. Every attempt to  describe dem must refer to de meaning which men wey dey act attach to dem. We fit call de offering of one commodity for sale one “stimulus.” But wetin dey essential for such offer and distinguish am from other offer nor go fit dey described without dem nor enter  into de meaning wey de acting parties attribute to de situation. No dialectical artifice go fit spirit away de fact say man dey driven by de aim to attain certain ends. Na dis purposeful behavior—viz., action—wey be de subject matter of our science. We nor go fit approach our subject if we disregard de meaning which man wey dey act attach to de situation, that is, de given state of affairs, and to e own behavior with regards to dis situation.

E nor dey appropriate for de physicist to search for final causes because dere is no indication say de event wey be de subject matter of physics dey to be interpreted as de outcome of actions of one being, dey aim at end for one human way. Or say e dey appropriate for de praxeologist to disregard de operation of de acting being’s volition and intention; dem na undoubtedly given facts. If he were to disregard am, he go cease to study human action. Very often—but not always—de events wey e concern go fit dey investigated both from de point of view of praxeology and from dat of natural sciences. But im wey deal with de discharging of one firearm from de physical and chemical point of view nor be praxeologist. He neglect de very problems wey de science of purposeful human behaviors aim to clarify.

#### On the Serviceableness of Instincts

The proof of the fact that only two avenues of approach are available for human research, causality or teleology, is provided by the problems raised in reference to the serviceableness of instincts. There are types of behavior which on the one hand cannot be thoroughly interpreted with the causal methods of the natural sciences, but on the other hand cannot be considered as purposeful human action. In order to grasp such behavior we are forced to resort to a makeshift. We assign to it the character of a quasi-action; we speak of serviceable instincts.

We observe two things: first the inherent tendency of a living organism to respond to a stimulus according to a regular pattern, and second the favorable effects of this kind of behavior for the strengthening or preservation of the organism's vital forces. If we were in a position to interpret such behavior as the outcome of purposeful aiming at certain ends, we would call it action and deal with it according to the teleological methods of praxeology. But as we found no trace of a conscious mind behind this behavior, we suppose that an unknown factor--we call it _instinct_--was instrumental. We say that the instinct directs quasi-purposeful animal behavior and unconscious but nonetheless serviceable responses of human muscles and nerves. Yet, the mere fact that we hypostatize the unexplained element of this behavior as a force and call it instinct does not enlarge our knowledge. We must never forget that this word instinct is nothing but a landmark to indicate a point beyond which we are unable, up to the present at least, to carry our scientific scrutiny.

Biology has succeeded in discovering a "natural," i.e., mechanistic, explanation for many processes which in earlier days were attributed to the operation of instincts. Nonetheless many others have remained which cannot be interpreted as mechanical or chemical responses to mechanical or chemical stimuli. Animals display attitudes which cannot be comprehended otherwise than through the assumption that a directing factor was operative.

The aim of behaviorism to study human action from without with the methods of animal psychology is illusory. As far as animal behavior goes beyond mere physiological processes like breathing and metabolism, it can only be investigated with the aid of the meaning-concepts developed by praxeology. The behaviorist approaches the object of his investigations with the human notions of purpose and success. He unwittingly applies to the subject matter of his studies the human concepts of serviceableness and perniciousness. He deceives himself in excluding all verbal reference to consciousness and aiming at ends. In fact his mind searches everywhere for ends and measures every attitude with the yardstick of a garbled notion of serviceableness. The science of human behavior--as far as it is not physiology--cannot abandon reference to meaning and purpose. It cannot learn anything from animal psychology and the observation of the unconscious reactions of newborn infants. It is, on the contrary, animal psychology and infant psychology which cannot renounce the aid afforded by the science of human action. Without praxeological categories we would be at a loss to conceive and to understand the behavior both of animals and of infants.

The observation of the instinctive behavior of animals fills man with astonishment and raises questions which nobody can answer satisfactorily. Yet the fact that animals and even plants react in a quasi-purposeful way is neither more nor less miraculous than that man thinks and acts, that in the inorganic universe those functional correspondences prevail which physics describes, and that in the organic universe biological processes occur. All this is miraculous in the sense that it is an ultimate given for our searching mind.

Such an ultimate given is also what we call animal instinct. Like the concepts of motion, force, life, and consciousness, the concept of instinct too is merely a term to signify an ultimate given. To be sure, it neither "explains" anything nor indicates a cause or an ultimate cause.[^10]

#### The Absolute End

In order to avoid any possible misinterpretation of the praxeological categories it seems expedient to emphasize a truism.

Praxeology, like the historical sciences of human action, deals with purposeful _human_ action. If it mentions _ends_, what it has in view is the ends at which acting men aim. If it speaks of _meaning_, it refers to the meaning which acting men attach to their actions.

Praxeology and history are manifestations of the human mind and as such are conditioned by the intellectual abilities of mortal men. Praxeology and history do not pretend to know anything about the intentions of an absolute and objective mind, about an objective meaning inherent in the course of events and of historical evolution, and about the plans which God or Nature or Weltgeist or Manifest Destiny is trying to realize in directing the universe and human affairs. They have nothing in common with what is called philosophy of history. They do not, like the works of Hegel, Comte, Marx, and a host of other writers, claim to reveal information about the true, objective, and absolute meaning of life and history.[^11]

#### Vegetative Man

Some philosophies advise men to seek as the ultimate end of conduct the complete renunciation of any action. They look upon life as an absolute evil full of pain, suffering, and anguish, and apodictically deny that any purposeful human effort can render it tolerable. Happiness can be attained only by complete extinction of consciousness, volition, and life. The only way toward bliss and salvation is to become perfectly passive, indifferent, and inert like the plants. The sovereign good is the abandonment of thinking and acting.

Such is the essence of the teachings of various Indian philosophies, especially of Buddhism, and of Schopenhauer. Praxeology does not comment upon them. It is neutral with regard to all judgments of value and the choice of ultimate ends. Its task is not to approve or to disapprove, but to describe what is.

The subject matter of praxeology is human action. It deals with acting man, not with man transformed into a plant and reduced to a merely vegetative existence.
